Hi Jeff,
   A collection of papers that review some performance issues of expression templates
are available and located on the web at:
   http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~dquinlan/publications/publications.html
As we complete more of our work and resolve more issues about performance of the object-oriented
frameworks we will publish more and place the resulting papers at the above URL.
This is work funded by the ROSE project to develop a preprocessor mechanism for doing semantics
based program transformations inorder to improve the performance of object-oriented frameworks.

The papers relevant to expression template problems are:
2.Bassetti, F., Davis, K., Quinlan, D. "Toward FORTRAN 77 Performance From Object-Oriented C++ Scientific
  Frameworks" (postscript version), Submitted to HPC'98 Conference, Boston, Mass. April 5-9, 1998

5.Bassetti, F., Davis, K., Quinlan, D. "A Comparison of Performance-enhancing Strategies for Parallel Numerical
  Object-Oriented Frameworks" (postscript version), To be published in Proceedings of the first International
