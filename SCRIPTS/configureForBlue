# This is an example configuration line, the use can pick and choose among numerous 
# options to control the compilation process in A++/P++.  These are useful scripts
# which can be used as examples.

# These options with the configure script select option specific for the ASCI Blue Pacific
# computer (and IBM system) with special scripts (mpcc and mpCC) to simplify the compilation
# of parallel applications.  Notice that INTERNALDEBUG is turned on, while this slows the 
# compuation, it is an important part of our internal debugging.  P++ is enabled using the
# --enable-PXX option because this computer is a large parallel machine where we want to
# test P++ in addition to A++.

./configure --enable-PXX --without-PADRE --enable-SHARED_LIBS --with-CC=mpcc_r --with-CXX=mpCC_r
