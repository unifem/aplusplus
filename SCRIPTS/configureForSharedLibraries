# This is an example configuration line, the use can pick and choose among numerous 
# options to control the compilation process in A++/P++.  These are useful scripts
# which can be used as examples.

# These options with the configure script override the default optimization levels
# so that the compilation can be done as fast as possible.  This can be a handy
# way of testing the configuration management (autoconf) mechanism within A++/P++.
# In this case we leave the optional parameter blank.   Since we test P++ as well,
# the --enable-PXX is included here.
./configure --enable-PXX --enable-SHARED_LIBS --without-PADRE
