# This is an example configuration line, the use can pick and choose among numerous 
# options to control the compilation process in A++/P++.  These are useful scripts
# which can be used as examples.

# Kuck and Associates C++ compiler (KCC).  Notice that internal debugging
# turned on, this slows the execution speed but is useful for testing.
