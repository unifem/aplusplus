P++ README file

   P++ has at present been used on a wide number of parallel machines.

***************************************************************************************
Some details of how A++ and P++ define COMPILE_APP, COMPILE_PPP, and COMPILE_SERIAL_APP
(include into the A++/P++ manual at some point)
***************************************************************************************

A single source code is used for both A++ and P++, the source for A++
and P++ is build from this single source (some of which contains m4
macros, but NONE of this is seen by the user).  These macro variables
are used to control which parts of the source code are seen when
compiling A++ and P++ (and within P++, the serial and parallel parts).

Additionally to optimize the compile time performance we provide two
paths through the header file structure in A++ and P++, one which is
used in the complilation of A++ and P++, and the other which is used
by the user to compile A++ and P++ applications (this saves a
noticable amount of time in the complilation, so we like this
feature).

By design A++ arrays are failr simple and exclude details of the parallel
implementation.  To simplify the paralle P++ array class the P++ array
objects make use of the A++ array objects (to hold the local processor's
piece of the distributed array).  The source code for the serial A++
array objects is nearly identical to the A++ source code, but with minor
modifications.  P++ is also very similar to the A++ source code, but
includes the parallel details and the calls to the A++ code for local
processor stuff.  As a result we use 3 slightly different versions of the 
same source code to implement both A++, the serial part of P++, and
the parallel P++.  To simplify this we use the same source code
with #ifdef's for each different case.  The following cpp macro
names are defined and explained:

COMPILE_APP: This variable is set in A++/config/config.h in the build
directory structure (as opposed to the source directory structure
where the source code is located).

COMPILE_PPP: This macro variable is defined when we are compiling the
parallel parts of P++.  It is NOT defined in the P++/config/config.h
header file, since this would have to be defined for the parallel
parts of P++ and undefined for the serial parts of P++ (where upon
COMPILE_SERIAL_APP would be defined).  So this variable is set in the
source file before A++.h is included.  Where the source code is
identical between A++ and P++ we define COMPILE_PPP if COMPILE_APP is
undefined.  So if we are not compiling for A++, then we assume we are
compiling for P++.

COMPILE_SERIAL_APP: This macro variable is defined when we are
compiling the serial parts of P++ (almost the same as A++ but for use
with P++). See the description for where COMPILE_PPP is set, 
COMPILE_SERIAL_APP is set similarly.  If we are compiling P++
then either COMPILE_PPP or COMPILE_SERIAL_APP must be set!
