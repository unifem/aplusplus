This is the PADRE Library.

The purpose of PADRE is to handle the distribution of data and
the communication that its manipulation requires.


=======================================================

Compiling with PADRE:

PADRE uses a number of sublibraries.  Some (such as PARTI and PGSLIB)
are distributed with PADRE, but others (such as GlobalArrays) are not.
If you would like to use a sublibrary that is NOT distributed with PADRE,
you are responsible for knowing where those sublibraries reside, the
compiler flags used for them, etc.  There are some autoconf macros
(located in config) to configure PADRE.  They are provided in the PADRE
distribution with the idea that they may be useful to another library
that uses PADRE.





=======================================================

Using the GlobalArrays sublibrary:

PADRE's use of GlobalArrays is very experimental.  Much of the code
is not even written yet.  We suggest that you do not use GlobalArrays
until a later date.
