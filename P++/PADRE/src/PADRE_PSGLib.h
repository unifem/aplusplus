// The use of PGSLib in PADRE differs from that of other distribution libraries
// in that PGSLib handles the more general gather/scatter operations of any distribution.
// Current use of PGSLib (as it will appear in PADRE) is implemented mostly in P++.
// The lowere levels of this support will be moved to PADRE as it is completed 
// and tested in P++.
