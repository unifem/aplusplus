Written by Brian Gunney, LLNL/CASC.

This directory, acmacros, contains fairly generic autoconf macros.
These macros were originally written for the A++P++ and PADRE projects.
They should be sufficiently generic for general use.

The macros use shell variable names that adhere to a standard that
I extrapolated from autoconf and automake macros.

The way I intend this directory to be used is as follows.  They reside
in the CVS repository /usr/casc/overture/gunney/cvsrepository.  All
of CASC has read but not write permission to this directory.  You can
check out and export acmacros, but you cannot check it in.  If you
made a change that should be checked in, please give me the new version
so I can check it in.

All macros are documented by comments in the macros.  If you need help
using them, please let me know.

If you intend to use these macros to set up your project's configuration,
you would ONLY be interested in the *.m4 files.  Other files, such as
configure.in, Makefile.am, etc., are for use by the acmacros project.
We use them to test the macros.  If they interfere with your own
project or your sense of aesthetics, you can remove them before using
acmacros.
